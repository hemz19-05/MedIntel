## Overview
This drug search application is rule-based and built to provide accurate and factual response on drug information. The APIs used were from:

1. OpenFDA
2. RXNorm

This app is different from Google searches because it detects the intent of the users' questions and generates responses accordingly whereas Google searches would throw the entire drug information to the user for them to look for the answer to their questions. Furthermore, AI summary and responses that are generated directly from drug APIs are much more reliable compared to AI summary on Google searches which could include hallucinated information. 

The tech stack includes:

1. Backend - Python
2. Frontend - Streamlit and Render
3. Database - PostgreSQL
