### MedIntel

# Overview
This application is built to provide accurate and factual response on drug information. The APIs used were from:

1. OpenFDA
2. RXNorm

This app is different from Google searches because it detects the intent of the users' questions and generates responses accordingly whereas Google searches would throw the entire drug information to the user for them to look for the answer to their questions.
